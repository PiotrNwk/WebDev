To make your table element spread out to about 90% of the screen width, you can adjust its CSS. Here's how you can do it:

Set the Width: Directly set the width of the table to 90% of its container (which is typically the viewport if not inside another element with a different width).
css
table {
  width: 90%;
}

This will make the table take up 90% of its parent container's width.
Responsive Design: If you want the table to adjust according to different screen sizes, consider using media queries or a more fluid design. Here's a simple example:
css
table {
  width: 100%; /* Full width on smaller screens */
  max-width: 90%; /* But not wider than 90% on larger screens */
}

@media (min-width: 768px) { /* Example breakpoint for tablets */
  table {
    max-width: 90%;
  }
}

This CSS makes the table take up 100% width on smaller screens but caps it at 90% on screens larger than 768px (an example breakpoint for tablet-sized screens).
Table Layout: If your table's cells are not filling the width properly, you might want to look into:
Table Layout Property: You can use table-layout: fixed; to make all cells in each column the same width, which can help in spreading out the table content more evenly. Here's how:
css
table {
  table-layout: fixed;
  width: 90%;
}
Column Widths: If you need more control, you can specify widths for table cells or columns:
css
table {
  width: 90%;
}
th, td {
  width: calc(90% / number_of_columns); /* Adjust 'number_of_columns' to your actual number */
}

However, using calc() with exact column counts might not be ideal in all scenarios, especially if your table has a dynamic number of columns.
Content Wrapping: Make sure that content within cells doesn't force the table to become narrower. Use:
css
th, td {
  white-space: nowrap; /* or normal if you want text to wrap */
  overflow: hidden; /* for handling overflow if nowrap is used */
  text-overflow: ellipsis; /* show ellipsis for overflowed text */
}

By implementing these CSS adjustments, your table should spread out to approximately 90% of the screen width, enhancing its appearance and usability. Remember to test these changes across different screen sizes to ensure the layout behaves as expected.
